UI description for cups configurator
====================================

CUPS config should be divided to:

> CUPS settings
  > Daemon settings
  > Printers
    > Autodetection
  > Classes
  > Mime
    > Types
    > Convs
> CUPS Print Jobs


Daemon settings
---------------
Settings for .cups.daemon (cups.txt 4.1 Daemon settings). First pages contain
single settings. List of location follows, list of users follows.

Printers
--------
--> think about autodetection. Do we want yast2 to autodetect printers every
time it is executed? I believe we do not. So there should be printer list and
buttons [Add] [Remove] [Edit] [Autodetect]. Or there can be an inviting screen
that offers [Autodetect printers] and [Skip autodetection].
For autodetected printers: The printer can be new (no printer on the same device
is configured) or can be already present in system.
New printers:
- Configurator must prompt user for name, location, comment,... user should also
  check ppd, ... 
- Or configurator just adds these printers to list and adds some generated
  names.
Already present printers (conflicts):
- Configurator must check if autodetected printer differs from the present
  (check if they use different ppd). If no, it can forget autodetected printer.
- If the printer differs, user must choose if he wants to use autodetected ppd
  or the old one. If user chooses autodetected, the printer
  name/comment/location can be used from the old printer.
