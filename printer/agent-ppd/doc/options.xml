of the PPD file and changing the options of the PPD file.

Options reading is realized using CUPS libraries, which provide functions to parse PPD files and examine their options. The only disadvantage of this access is the need to have
installed CUPS libraries. Getting of lists of option groups is also possible (see interface description).
Supported is getting options for both one option group and all options of PPD file. Each got option contains current default value as is set in the PPD file, option key and
readable name, and additional values used for displaying of widget for changing the option.

Patching changed options to PPD files is realized by small in Perl written agent. As parameters get original PPD file name, target filename and map of options, and patches all
present options to PPD file, which can then be used by spooler. The agent works with both compressed (using gzip) and uncompressed PPD files, output file is always uncompressed.
Check for present *Default... entries and replaces them with other ones according to options got from the configuration module.
