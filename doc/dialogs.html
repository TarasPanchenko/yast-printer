This document describes dialogs that appear in printer configurator.
</P>
<P>
File: <TT>printconf.ycp</TT><br>
Main, so called complex dialog. The list of already configured printers is here,
user can add, delete, edit printer and set printer as default.
</p>
<P>
File: <TT>printconf_ask_device.ycp</TT><BR>
Ask user about settings for parallel port, usb, and serial port. User must enter
port number. For serial port user must choose speed. User can test connection
here. 
</P>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_ask_remote.ycp</TT><br>
Ask user about settings for remote connection. For tcp/ip forwarding queue,
samba and novell printer requires user to specify remote host-name and remote
queue name. For samba and novell user can enter username and password. For
pre-filter queue user must specify tcp/ip queue - printconf can create new or
already existing can be chosen.
</p>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_device_confirm.ycp</TT><br>
This screen shows one auto-detected printer. If printer is fully auto-detected,
user can configure it with detected manufacturer and model (button "next") or
configure it manually (choose other manufacturer/model). User can skip printer.
</p>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_features.ycp</TT><br>
Features of ascii printing. User can choose whether to print one page or two
pages per sheet, if header will be printed, and portrait/landscape
printing. User can choose encoding (between ISO-8859-[1|2] and system default). 
</p>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_filter.ycp</TT><br>
Filter options - settings of ghostscript. Paper size, color printing, dpi
resolution, printer specific options. <small>This dialog should be redesigned
because it contains depended options. It means that change of value of some
option can change some other options.</small>
</p>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_manuf_model.ycp</TT><br>
User chooses manufacturer and model. List of manufacturers are in left selection
box and list of models are in right selection box. If there can be a problem
with some model (e.g. GDI printer), information window is popped up. User can
view an info about selected manufacturer and model.
</p>
<p>
File: <TT>printconf_spool_info.ycp</TT><br>
Users specifies name for printer queue. For tcp/ip fwd queue there is only on
queue name (because input is not filtered and data are sent directly to remote
queue). If new tcp/ip fwd queue is created for pre-filter queue, user enters also
name for this queue. For all other printers user enters queue name. Name for
ascii printing is derived from it by adding "-ascii".
