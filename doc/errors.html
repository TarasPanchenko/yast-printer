<H2>YaST2 Printer configuration, Error messages</H2>
<b>No print spooler is installed. You must install package lprold in order to
print.</b><br>No print spooler is installed.<hr>
<b>You must be root to run printer configuration tool.</b><br>...<hr>
<b>FATAL: I am unable to find the printer database!</b><br>Check if there are
files <tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/printers.ycp</tt> and 
<tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/printer_macros.ycp</tt>.<hr>
<b>FATAL: I am unable to restart the lpd daemon!
 You may not have installed lpd (one of
 the lprold, plp or lprng packages) or
 you are not user 'root'.</b><br>This happens after unsuccessful<br><tt>/etc/init.d/lpd
stop<br>/etc/init.d/lpd</tt><br>
Try <tt>/etc/init.d/lpd stop</tt> manually.<hr>
<b>It appears that you do not have GhostScript installed on your computer. It is necessary  in order to print.</b><br>...<hr>
<b>ERROR: I was unable to read the current configuration!</b><br>Is there file
<tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/clients_non_y2/printconf_parse_printcap</tt>? (For 7.1 it was 
<tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/clients/printconf_parse_printcap</tt>) Try to run it.<hr>
<b>This printer was not created by YaST2 and therefore it can not be
edited.</b><br>
You have chosen to edit printer that can not be edited.
<hr>
<b>You must choose some printer.</b><br>You want to delete/edit/set as default
but you have not chosen printer.<hr>
<b>Can't create directory '/etc/gs.upp'!</b><br>...<hr>
<b>ERROR: I am unable to find the test
page /usr/lib/YaST2/suse_testpg.(ps|ascii).</b><br>...<hr>
<b>I was unable to print the testpage.
Check /tmp/YaST2-XXXX/suse_testpg.ps.</b><br>
This message appears when there is any error from lpr.
Usually it has nothing to do with the testpage file.
<font color="red">TODO: Message must be changed!</font><hr>
<b>I have not found any parallel devices (/dev/lp?)! It seems
that your parallel port is not properly configured.</b><br>And similar messages
for USB and serial. Printconf looks into /proc to find ports. If it does not
find any, it will offer default.<hr>
<b>YaST2 printconf cannot read the configuration data.
Possible reasons:
 - The configuration was not made by this YaST2 version.
 - The file /etc/gs.upp/y2prn_%1.yast2 is corrupted or doesn't exist.
Possible solution:
 Remove the printer and add it again.</b><br>It is quite self-descripting.<hr>
<b>I tried to auto-detect parallel and USB printers,
but I haven't found any on your computer.</b><br>This message is obsoleted and
is never shown. <font color="red">TODO: clearify if it should be shown</font><hr>
<b>You entered a wrong remote name. It must be
shorter than 30 characters and you can only use
0..9, A..Z, a..z, spaces, - and _.</b><br>...<hr>
<b>Invalid name! The name should be less than 20 characters long and
can only use the characters 0..9, A..Z, a..z and _. Additionally,
you cannot use the names 'lp', 'lp&lt;number&gt;', 'ascii', 'raw' and
'remote' because of their special function.

The name must not be used for another printer.</b><br>...<hr>
<b>Call of apsfilter.setup (/var/lib/....) was not successful.</b><br>
This is shown when saving settings (or before testpage printing) when apsfilter
call returns an error or when /etc/printcap does not exist after apsfilter
call.<hr>
<b>I cannot write /etc/gs.upp/.....upp.
Please, check that you are
logged in as the user root.</b><br>
Printconf was not able to write upp file. <font color="red">TODO: remark about
root is nonsense because only root can run printconf.</font><hr>
<b>I cannot configure a remote
queue. The internal structure
is not filled properly.</b><br>
Hostname, remote queue name or local queue name was not specified for remote
printer. It should not happen because data are checked in dialogs.
