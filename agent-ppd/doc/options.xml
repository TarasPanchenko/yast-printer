PPD agent provides functions to prepare PPD file for changes (which means copy to any writable directory and uncompress if it is compressed), getting a list of changable options
of the PPD file and changing the options of the PPD file.

Options reading is realized using CUPS libraries, which provide functions to parse PPD files and examine their options. The only disadvantage of this access is the need to have
installed CUPS libraries. Supported is getting options for both one option group and all options of PPD file. Each got option contains current default value as is set in the PPD file.
    </para>

Patching changed options to PPD files is realized by small in Perl written agent. As parameters get original PPD file name, target filename and map of options, and patches all
present options to PPD file, which can then be used by spooler.
