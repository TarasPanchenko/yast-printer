    <title>Equivalence lists</title>
    <para>
Eqiovalence lists are used to make equivalent printers really equivalent. It means that all printers made by HP will be sorted under one manufacturer (named HP) and not under two
(one HP and the other one Hewlett-Packard), and two PPD files made for one model would make only one entry (and not two entries "XXX" and "XXX series").
    </para>
    <para>
All comparsion are done in uppercase and (in case of model names)
without any meaningless characters (to simplify the list of equivalence).
    </para>
    <para>
When selecting what label should be used for the model (if two of them are equivalent) the shorter label is selected.

	<title>Vendors equivalence lists</title>
	<para>
Vendors equivalence list is hardcoded in the agent. It is simple and contains only entries like "VENDOR_NAME" -> "REAL_VENDOR_NAME".

	<title>Models equivalence lists</title>
	<para>
Because there are much more different models than vendors, more sophisticated method is used. Sepaarte file (<computeroutput>/usr/share/YaST2/data/printer/models.equiv</computeroutput>)
for storing equivalences exists. Each line means one equivalence, and contains 3 entries (separated with slash): 
	</para>
	<orderedlist>
	    <listitem><para>Vendor name</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Model regular expression</para></listitem>
	    <listitem><para>Model pattern</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	<para>
Additionally, there is one special vendor named <computeroutput>_ALL_</computeroutput>, which is entry usable for all vendors.
	</para>
	<para>
Equivalence evaluation is done in two steps: In the first step first matching regular expression of entries specific for vendor is found and regexpsub is run according 
this entry. In the second step the same is done for entries or all vendors (first matching is found and regexpsub called). This means that regexpsub is called maximally twice.
